# M.Sc.-Thesis-Semi-supervised-Implementations-for-Human-TCR-epitope-Interaction-Modelling
M.Sc. Thesis in Data Science at University of Milano-Bicocca by Fabio Affaticati.

The code contained in this repository is at the basis of Thesis in Data Science developed with the partecipation of members of the University of Antwerp and biomina (biomedical informatics research network Antwerp). The collaboration sparked from a previous internship on the same topic during an Erasmus period in Belgium.
The starting point of this research is a tool developed internally by biomina: TCRex. 
TCRex is a Random Forest-based TCR-epitope binding predictive model. The work here presented sets out to implement semi-supervised learning to show if an improvement in its performance is possible.
